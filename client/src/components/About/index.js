              We admit, there are other budget calculators out there. However, 
              many fail to address the needs of university students, particularly 
              those at the University of Waterloo. The Hungry Warrior is made for 
              students by students. As a result, we are more receptive to understanding how students 
              such as yourself think and the issues faced. Most calculators are too generic and do 
              not provide specific recommendations. Our app takes budgeting to the next level by 
              showing students actual restaurant, entertainment and living options within their 
              expense range. Furthermore, The Hungry Warrior considers the userâ€™s preferences 
              and works to optimize their happiness throughout the term. Overall, this tool 
              will allow you to properly forecast your finances to save time and money.
