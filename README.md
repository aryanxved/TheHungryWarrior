We know that Waterloo students undergo a tedious preparation process before classes start for the term. Everything from finding a place, paying thousands in tuition to having to figure out what they want for lunch. Planning a budget that includes residence, food, entertainment, and even travel can take time. Currently, many students have to calculate their term budget by hand, often leading to a suboptimal solution. This is where our proposed tool, “The Hungry Warrior,” comes in. We created this program with the goal of helping University of Waterloo students just like you. 

This web tool is your one-stop budget calculator for navigating your term at the University of Waterloo. We focus on making educated recommendations based on your preferences and available budget. The Hungry Warrior allows you to plan your housing, food, and entertainment choices over the next 4 months. Additional filters allow you to fine tune the results to get results tailored to your liking. 

We admit, there are other budget calculators out there. However, many fail to address the needs of university students, particularly those at the University of Waterloo. The Hungry Warrior is made for students by students. As a result, we are more receptive to understanding how students such as yourself think and the issues faced. Most calculators are too generic and do not provide specific recommendations. Our app takes budgeting to the next level by showing students actual restaurant, entertainment and living options within their expense range. Furthermore, The Hungry Warrior considers the user’s preferences and works to optimize their happiness throughout the term. Overall, this tool will allow you to properly forecast your finances to save time and money.
